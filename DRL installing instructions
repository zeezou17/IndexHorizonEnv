INSTALL MINICONDA: 
Download miniconda from here: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html 
Setup the directory for miniconda
Check Anaconda's version by executing conda --version
You should get this "conda 4.x.xx" 
If Anaconda's version is <=4.6.8, run "conda update conda"
INSTALL pip3 and Tensorflow 

INSTALL DRL FRAMEWORKS:
Clone the entire repository from "https://github.com/pshevche/drl-frameworks"(This clones dopamine, horizon and ray)
Open the Terminal and set the path of the downloaded repository
Create Anaconda environments by running ./scripts/setup.sh.
RUNNING SAMPLE EXPERIMENTS IN CARTPOLE ENVIRONMENT:
Cartpole is one of the environments in which we can train our agents. 
Three agents available: DQN IQ Rainbow
You can train any one of the agents in Cartpole.

STEPS FOR SAMPLE TRAINING:
1. Select the agent you would like to train. 
2. Agents are available in "drl-frameworks-master/src/horizon(or)dopamine(or)ray/experiments/cartpole" 
   --> Agents are available under all three frameworks. You can choose any one framework. 
3. Change the hyperparameters inside the selected agent
(Eg.) dqn agent --> Change the number of iterations =5(for our testing purpose);
( timesteps = 5000 in horizon and Ray) 
4. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where "drl-frameworks-master" is installed 
5. Run the command "./scripts/setup.sh" (This creates the conda environment if already not created) 
6. Next Run the experiment using the command "/scripts/evaluate.sh" 
   --> This must be run under the directory "drl-frameworks-master/<framework>" 
7. You will get this message "--- EVALUATION COMPLETED ---" 
8. After this, run "tensorboard --logdir=results",this plots the results from the results foler and you will receive a website link i.e. http://NAME:xxxx (x--> integer) 
9. You can view the results in the website link.
